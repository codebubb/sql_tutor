# SQL Practice

An application to monitor students in a classroom writing SQL queries.  Users log in to a main portal by entering their name which spins up a copy of a pre-made SQLite database.  The users can then run queries and see their individual results against the database.  

Icing on the cake is that a tutor can connect as admin and then view all of the input being typed by the students and offer assistance if any mistakes are being made.

To do:

  * [] Portal page
  * [] Handle differentiation between Admin / User
  * [] Implement SQL query run
  * [] Implement Copy of SQLite database on connection
  * [] UI



To install:

```bash
npm install
```

To run:
```bash
node index
```
